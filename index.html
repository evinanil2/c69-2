      <p class="text-muted">St. Stephen's Cathedral (German: Stephansdom) is the mother church of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Vienna and the seat of the Archbishop of Vienna, Christoph Cardinal Schönborn, OP.
         The current Romanesque and Gothic form of the cathedral, seen today in the Stephansplatz, was largely initiated by Duke Rudolf IV (1339–1365) and stands on the ruins of two earlier churches, the first a parish church consecrated in 1147.
          The most important religious building in Vienna, St. Stephen's Cathedral has borne witness to many important events in Habsburg and Austrian history and has, with its multi-coloured tile roof, become one of the city's most recognizable symbols</p>

          <p class="text-muted">A school library (or a school library media center) is a library within a school where students, staff, and often, parents of a public or private school have access to a variety of resources.
             The goal of the school library media center is to ensure that all members of the school community have equitable access "to books and reading, to information, and to information technology.
             "[1] A school library media center "uses all types of media... is automated, and utilizes the Internet [as well as books] for information gathering.
             "[2] School libraries are distinct from public libraries because they serve as "learner-oriented laboratories which support, extend, and individualize the school's curriculum... A school library serves as the center and coordinating agency for all material used in the school."[3]</p>

                The facility is the home of the Performing Arts Academy, which at the present time offers performance opportunities in choir, children’s theater, dinner theater, recital hall for concerts and musical theater.
                 The facility also supports a technical theatre program and, on occasion, may host outside presenters as well.
                A student quad with a memorial plaza dedicated to the late math teacher, Jaime Escalante, and four public art projects were also part of the project.</p>
